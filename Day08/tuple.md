# Tuple
A tuple is a data structure similar to a list, but unlike lists Tuples in Python are immutable, which means their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed after creation.

Tuples are typically used for grouping related data.

--> you create a tuple using parentheses:

my_tuple = (1, 2, 'cloud', 'Devops')
