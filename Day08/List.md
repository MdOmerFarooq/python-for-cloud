# List 
A list is a fundamental data structure in programming that allows you to store a collection of items. Lists are ordered and can contain elements of various data types, such as numbers, strings, and objects.

--> you create a list using square brackets:

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'cloud', 'Devops']
