# Loops

Loops allow us to perform repetitive tasks efficiently. There are two primary types of loops: "for" and "while."

## For Loop

The "for" loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a set of statements for each item in the sequence. The loop continues until all items in the sequence have been processed.

**Syntax:**

```python
for variable in sequence:
    # Code to be executed for each item in the sequence
```

**Example:**

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

**Output:**

```
apple
banana
cherry
```

The loop iterates over the "fruits" list, and in each iteration, the "fruit" variable takes on the value of the current item in the list.

#### While Loop

The "while" loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It's often used when we don't know in advance how many times the loop should run.

**Syntax:**

```python
while condition:
    # Code to be executed as long as the condition is true
```

**Example:**

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

**Output:**

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

The "while" loop continues to execute as long as the "count" is less than 5. The "count" variable is incremented in each iteration.


# Loop Control Statements 

Loop control statements are used to modify the behavior of loops, providing greater control and flexibility during iteration. There are two primary loop control statements i.e "break" and "continue."

## `break` 

The "break" statement is used to exit the loop prematurely. It can be applied to both "for" and "while" loops, allowing us to terminate the loop when a particular condition is met.

**Example:**

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for number in numbers:
    if number == 3:
        break
    print(number)
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
```

In this example, the loop stops when it encounters the number 3.

## `continue` 

The "continue" statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next one. It can be used in both "for" and "while" loops, enabling you to bypass certain iterations based on a condition.

**Example:**

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for number in numbers:
    if number == 3:
        continue
    print(number)
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
4
5
```

In this example, the loop skips the iteration where the number is 3 and continues with the next iteration.
