# SETS

A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is useful for mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference.

---> Creating a Set:
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

---> Adding and Removing Elements:
my_set.add(6)  # Adding an element
my_set.remove(3)  # Removing an element
