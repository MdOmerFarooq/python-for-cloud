# command-line arguments (CLI args)
command-line arguments (CLI args) are values you pass to a script when running it from the terminal.

you just pass it right after the the file name 
for example : python my_file.py arg1 arg2 arg3 

but but but we need to import the "sys" module in my_file.py and use sys.argv[arg1 ] to read the input
