 variable is a named storage location used to store data. Variables are essential for programming as they allow us to work with data, manipulate it, and make our code more flexible and reusable. <br>

 Variable Scope: In Python, variables have different scopes, which determine where in the code the variable can be accessed. <br> There are mainly two types of variable scopes: <br>

Local Scope: Variables defined within a function have local scope and are only accessible inside that function. <br>
Global Scope: Variables defined outside of any function have global scope and can be accessed throughout the entire code.

It's important to follow naming conventions and best practices for variables to write clean and maintainable code: <br>

Variable names should be descriptive and indicate their purpose. <br>
Use lowercase letters and separate words with underscores (snake_case) for variable names. <br>
Avoid using reserved words (keywords) for variable names. <br>
Choose meaningful names for variables. <br>
