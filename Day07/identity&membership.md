# Identity operators

Identity operators in Python are used to compare the memory locations of two objects to determine if they are the same object or not. The two identity operators are "is" and "is not."

For instance :
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = x  # y now refers to the same object as x
result = x is y
--> result will be True

# Membership operators
Membership operators in Python are used to check whether a value is present in a sequence or collection, such as a list, tuple, or string. The membership operators are "in" and "not in."
