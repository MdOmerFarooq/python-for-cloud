A function in Python is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are defined using the def keyword and can take inputs, called arguments. They are a way to encapsulate and reuse code.

-> you can call the funtion using function name <br>
-> any variable defined inside the fuunction is limited to that function only <br>
-> you can use global variable inside the function <br>
